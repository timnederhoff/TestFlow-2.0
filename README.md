# The New Test Flow explained

## `<goal>test</goal>`
The goal of the new test flow is to save time. Also being more efficient in test steps. Also to have a better and more representative report.

## `test.how();`
By following certain principles:
1. verifications (assert/expect) are executed in parallel
1. a test has 3 possible outcomes: Passed, Failed and Untested
   * Passed: when a verification action passed
   * Failed: when a verification action failed
   * Untested: one of steps before verification actions fails
1. a scenario is a set of tests that result from one test flow
1. every verification in a flow defines 1 test
1. testing "through": after the verification actions, regardless of the result, the flow continues with other steps and verifications
1. the report contains the following matrices for each scenario: executed/aborted tests ratio, passed/executed ratio.

The above diagram shows that with one flow different tests are executed. These tests are reported:
* Test 1: steps 1, 2, 3a
* Test 2: steps 1, 2, 3b
* Test 3: steps 1, 2, 3c
* Test 4: steps 1, 2, 4, 5a
* Test 5: steps 1, 2, 4, 5b
